        <h1>About the Project Flowchart</h1>
        <p>Welcome to UTD's Degree Flowchart for Engineering majors! Whether you're a prospective student, current learner or just a curious individual, this visual roadmap highlights the invigorating academic journey ahead.</p>
        <p>This Flowchart represents courses you will take based on the major of your choice. From classes that develop your base to courses related to particular niches, it's all mapped out. Each box represents courses in order of semesters. Hovering your mouse over some boxes will highlight other courses. These highlighted courses are requisites to the class your mouse is hovering on. As mentioned before, this Flowchart is currently limited to only Engineering students, though we hope to add more majors very soon!</p>
        <p>Viewing this Flowchart is beneficial for many reasons. You can use it for clarity, so that you don't have to wander through course catalogs. You can also use it for planning and advising sessions, so that during your meetings with your counselors and advisors, a quick glance will remove any doubts of which classes you want to enroll in.</p>
        <p>The Project Flowchart was developed as a project to assist students in planning their courses throughout their academic career. The colour code is at the bottom left of the Flowchart.</p>
